# UnderControl
UnderControl is a smart parental monitoring app designed to ensure children's safety while respecting their independence. The system consists of two connected Android apps: one for the parent and one for the child.


The parent app offers real-time tools to track and communicate with the child's device:

Live GPS tracking via Google Maps

Geofence alerts – receive a notification when the child leaves a defined safe area

Battery monitoring – get alerts when the child’s battery is low

Remote microphone and camera access (with child-side approval or command trigger)

Emergency SOS notifications

Live video or audio streaming (WebRTC-based)

The child app runs in the background and ensures constant connection with the parent's app via Firebase Realtime Database, while prioritizing low battery consumption and security.

Whether you're at work or home, UnderControl gives parents peace of mind and children the space to grow – with safety just a tap away.
